-- Calculate the factorial of the following number
6

if dup 1 > then
    -- Push a sentinel value under our number
    0 swap

    -- Push the values from n to 1 onto the stack
    while dup 1 > do dup 1 - ;

    -- While we haven't hit the sentinel value,
    -- reduce by multiplying the top two numbers
    while 2nd do * ;

    -- Discard the sentinel
    swap drop

else 1;

-- Print to show off the correct answer
